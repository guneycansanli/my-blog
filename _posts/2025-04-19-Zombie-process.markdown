## What Is a Zombie Process in Linux?

Ever noticed a mysterious `<defunct>` process sitting quietly in your `ps` output? That’s a **zombie process** — a child process that has completed execution but still lingers in the process table.

In Linux, when a child process exits, it leaves behind an exit status that the **parent process** needs to collect. Until that status is read, the process isn’t completely removed from the process table. During that time, it’s considered a **zombie**.

Normally, the parent reaps the child’s exit status using `wait()` or `waitpid()`. If it fails to do so — either because it’s sleeping, buggy, or ignoring signals — the zombie sticks around.

---

## Creating a Zombie Process (Code Example)

Let’s take a simple example to demonstrate this. We’ll fork a child process, let it terminate immediately, and then delay the parent:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
    pid_t pid = fork();

    if (pid == 0) {
        // This is the child process
        printf("Child process (PID: %d) exiting...\n", getpid());
        exit(0);
    } else {
        // Parent goes to sleep
        printf("Parent sleeping... (PID: %d)\n", getpid());
        sleep(120);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

Execute c code and run:

```bash
gcc -o zombie zombie.c
./zombie
```

##  What Happens in This Program?

- The child process prints a message and exits instantly.
- The parent process, however, **sleeps for 120 seconds**.
- In this time, the child’s exit status goes uncollected.
- Hence, the child becomes a **zombie process**.

---

##  Verifying the Zombie

Once this code runs, we can use standard process tools to observe the zombie:

```bash
ps aux | grep Z
```

Or:

```bash
ps -eo pid,ppid,stat,cmd | grep defunct
```

Look for processes with status `Z` or the word `<defunct>` in the command column.

Or:

You can use **top** command to see zombie processes

##  Why Zombie Processes Matter

While a few zombie processes aren’t dangerous, a large number of them can fill the **finite process table**. When that happens:

- No new processes can be created.
- The system may hang or stop functioning properly.

That’s why it’s important to clean up or prevent zombie processes in production systems.

---

## Preventing Zombie Processes

Let’s look at a couple of ways to **prevent** zombies from appearing.

### Method 1: Use `wait()` or `waitpid()`

Here’s a revised version of our earlier program with proper cleanup:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <sys/wait.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
    pid_t pid = fork();

    if (pid == 0) {
        printf("Child (PID: %d) exiting now.\n", getpid());
        exit(0);
    } else {
        wait(NULL); // Wait for child to finish
        printf("Parent (PID: %d) has reaped the child.\n", getpid());
    }

    return 0;
}
```

This ensures that the parent immediately collects the child's status after termination.

---

### Method 2: Use Signal Handlers

Instead of blocking on `wait()`, you can set up a signal handler for `SIGCHLD`:

```c
#include <signal.h>
#include <sys/wait.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdio.h>

void handle_sigchld(int sig) {
    wait(NULL); // Clean up child
}

int main() {
    signal(SIGCHLD, handle_sigchld);
    fork(); // Create child
    sleep(30); // Parent stays alive
    return 0;
}
```

This non-blocking way helps clean up child processes as soon as they exit.

---

### Method 3: Ignore SIGCHLD

If you don’t care about the child’s exit status, you can ask the system to auto-clean them:

```c
signal(SIGCHLD, SIG_IGN);
```

But note: this is not always safe or recommended in complex apps, especially those that need child process status.

---

## Can You Kill a Zombie?

Technically, **no** — zombie processes are already dead.

Instead, your goal is to **notify or terminate the parent process** so it can collect the child’s exit code.

### Step 1: Find the Zombie’s Parent

```bash
ps -o ppid= -p <Zombie_PID>
```

### Step 2: Nudge the Parent with SIGCHLD

```bash
kill -s SIGCHLD <Parent_PID>
```

If that fails:

### Step 3: Terminate the Parent

```bash
kill -9 <Parent_PID>
```

This allows the zombie to be reaped by **init/systemd**, which becomes its new parent.

---

## Final Solution: Reboot

If zombie processes accumulate and their parent is already dead or misbehaving, a **reboot** may be the only solution to reclaim process table slots.

---

## Summary

- Zombie processes = dead children waiting for their parent to collect exit status.
- Not harmful in small numbers, but deadly in bulk.
- Prevent them with `wait()`, signal handlers, or ignoring `SIGCHLD`.
- Clean them up by getting the parent to act — or rebooting if all else fails.

## Bonus: Commands Cheat Sheet

| Action                  | Command                                |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| List zombies            | `ps aux | grep Z`                      |
| Find zombie parent      | `ps -o ppid= -p <Zombie_PID>`          |
| Signal parent           | `kill -s SIGCHLD <Parent_PID>`         |
| Force kill parent       | `kill -9 <Parent_PID>`                 |
| Reboot system           | `sudo reboot`                          |
