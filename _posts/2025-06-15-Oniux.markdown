# Oniux: Kernel-Level Tor Isolation for Linux — A Privacy Game-Changer

When every packet counts, whether you’re a journalist in hostile regions or a developer protecting sensitive metadata, traditional tools can fall short. **Oniux** is a new command-line utility from the Tor Project that uses Linux namespaces to enforce true Tor routing at the kernel level—no leaks, no proxy bypass, no compromises.

---

## Why Oniux Matters

Most tools, like Torsocks, rely on `LD_PRELOAD` to hijack libc calls, redirecting them to Tor’s SOCKS proxy. However:

- Static binaries or apps using raw system calls can evade these hooks—risking leaks.
- Misconfigurations or clever bypasses can expose real IPs.
- Torsocks doesn’t protect against DNS leaks or bypass at the kernel level.

Enter **Oniux**, built on Tor’s Rust-based Arti and the `onionmasq` framework. It creates an isolated network namespace—complete with a custom `onion0` interface and Tor-first DNS resolution—ensuring every bit of traffic goes through Tor. Leaks? Practically impossible. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

---

## Under the Hood: How It Works

1. **Namespace Isolation**  
   Uses `clone(2)` to spawn a process with its own network, mount, PID, and user namespace—cut off from `eth0` and other real interfaces.

2. **Virtual Tor Interface**  
   `onionmasq` sets up `onion0`, a TUN interface forced through Tor’s circuit.

3. **Secure DNS**  
   A bind-mounted `resolv.conf` ensures all domain lookups go through Tor's DNS resolver—no exceptions.

4. **Privilege Minimization**  
   Drops capabilities once everything is configured, then executes your command inside this sealed environment.

## Oniux vs Torsocks — Side by Side

| Feature                     | Oniux (Kernel-Level)                            | Torsocks (LD_PRELOAD)                             |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Application compatibility   | *All* Linux apps (static, dynamic, Rust, Zig)   | Only dynamically linked <br> C-based apps         |
| Leak resistance             | Kernel enforced—no accidental bypasses          | Vulnerable to raw syscalls and misconfigured libs |
| DNS security                | Tor-only resolver                               | May leak via host DNS                             |
| Isolation approach          | Complete namespace isolation                    | Applies only to libc-level traffic                |
| Platform support            | Linux only                                      | Cross-platform                                    |
| Stability                   | Experimental, improving                         | Mature, 15+ years stable                          |
| Tech stack                  | Rust (Arti, onionmasq)                          | C (CTor)                                          |

A direct comparison shows Oniux’s approach eliminates entire classes of leakage risk that Torsocks leaves open :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}.

## Getting Started with Oniux

Ensure you have:
- A Linux system
- Rust toolchain

### Install Rust on Ubuntu/Debian via rustup (recommended)

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y curl build-essential gcc make
```

### Download and run rustup installer

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh -s -- -y
```

### Activate Rust environment in current shell
```bash
source "$HOME/.cargo/env"
```

### Verify installation
```bash
rustc --version  # should display e.g. "rustc 1.xx.x (yyyy-mm-dd)" :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
```

### (Optional) Install via APT (older version):
```bash
sudo apt install -y rustc
rustc --version
```

## Then install Oniux:

```bash
cargo install --git https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/oniux --tag v0.4.0 oniux
```

# Practical Use Cases

1. Check your Tor IP (IPv4 or IPv6)

```bash
oniux curl https://icanhazip.com
oniux curl -6 https://ipv6.icanhazip.com
```

![oni][2]

2. Visit .onion sites

```bash
oniux curl http://exampleonionaddress.onion
```

3. “Torify” an entire shell session

```bash
oniux bash
```

![oni][3]

4. Isolate GUI apps (e.g. chat clients)

```bash
oniux hexchat
```

5. Secure Git operations

```bash
oniux git clone https://private.repo.example.org/org/project.git
```

6. Anonymize database backups

```bash
oniux pg_dump -h db.secure.internal -U user mydb > mydb.sql
```

7. Network scanning through Tor

```bash
oniux nmap -sT -p 443 example.com
```

8. CI/CD pipelines with enforced Tor routing

```bash
oniux ./run_tests.sh
```


# Final Thoughts
Oniux offers a leap in privacy protection by sealing applications within their own Tor routing environment. Its Rust and namespace-based design neutralizes weaknesses inherent in LD_PRELOAD tools. While it’s still experimental, it’s robust and powerful enough for admins and privacy-focused pros.

If you're working in high-stakes environments—journalism, data research, threat intelligence, or sensitive development—Oniux is a compelling upgrade. Install it, experiment, file issues, and help shape its path toward maturity.
